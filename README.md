This project is a Kanban Board made with React and Tailwind CSS.
It helps to organize work into three stages:

To Do – Tasks that need to be started (You can add tasks here).

In Progress – Tasks that are currently being worked on.

Done – Finished tasks.

You can:

Add, edit, and delete tasks.

Drag and drop tasks between columns.

Mark tasks with Low, Medium, or High priority.

Search tasks by name and filter them by priority.

See a colorful, modern, and responsive UI with hover effects.

The main goal of this project is to make task management easy and visual.
